# this repository will hold some flowcharts from recent projects for anybody who is intrested in what we do
This repository holds SVG's from current jobs to be shown on a webpage or for your development.
We just started with documenting like this, so pleas don't judge to hard on us

To embed your SVG on any webpage:
the public URL for a http - request is

1. Go To your file in the repository.
2. copy the link in the URL
3. change the domain from github.com to
   raw.githubusercontent.com 
4. Remove the folder /blob from the URL 
5. Add ?sanitize=true to the end of the URL
6. FINISHED :) embed the new url to an <object> or <img> - TAG and feel happy
 
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adoptimize/documentation-public/master/xtCommerce-Recover-Cart-Sales-Extended.svg?sanitize=true

# js: onclick="window.open(this.src)"
To show the svg in an interface add this attr. to your TAG ;)



have fun and let us know when things are really bad
